dhole
=====

A Ruby gem with ActiveRecord models and relations for the Mediawiki DB schema.


What is a Dhole?
================

I thought of calling this gem *mworm* - Mediawiki ORM - but figured as long as we're entering worm territory, we may as well go all the way.  Besides:

"Dholes are huge, slimy worm-like creatures, at least several hundred feet long. Because they avoid daylight and are covered in viscous goo, their features are nearly impossible to discern." --https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhole_%28Cthulhu_Mythos%29

...and that is a pretty good description of the Mediawiki DB schema, right? :)
